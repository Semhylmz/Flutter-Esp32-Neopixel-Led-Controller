## ESP32s NeoPixel Control with Mobile App

This project utilizes an ESP32s microcontroller to control NeoPixel LEDs and allows configuration through a mobile application.  The mobile app enables users to:

* Change LED color: Select a desired color from a color picker interface.
* Choose animation: Select and display pre-programmed animations on the NeoPixel strip.
* Adjust brightness: Control the overall brightness of the NeoPixel LEDs.


### Features

* **ESP32s Microcontroller:** Leverages the powerful ESP32s for real-time control of NeoPixel LEDs.
* **NeoPixel LED Support:** Control a variety of NeoPixel LED strips and configurations.
* **Mobile App Interface:** User-friendly mobile app for intuitive control over LED color, animation, and brightness.
* **Color Picker:** Select any desired color for the NeoPixels.
* **Animation Library:** Pre-programmed animations provide dynamic lighting effects.
* **Brightness Control:** Adjust the overall intensity of the NeoPixel LEDs.

### Getting Started

This repository contains the source code for both the ESP32s firmware and the mobile application.  To get started, you will need:

* An ESP32s development board
* NeoPixel LED strip (compatible with your chosen library)
* A mobile device compatible with your chosen mobile app development framework

**Hardware Setup:**

1. Connect your NeoPixel strip to the ESP32s according to the specific pin configuration used in the code.
2. Ensure your ESP32s development board is properly powered.

**Software Setup:**

1. Install the Arduino IDE ([https://support.arduino.cc/hc/en-us/articles/360019833020-Download-and-install-Arduino-IDE](https://support.arduino.cc/hc/en-us/articles/360019833020-Download-and-install-Arduino-IDE)) and configure it for the ESP32s board (refer to ESP32 development documentation for specific instructions).
2. Install any necessary libraries for NeoPixel control (e.g., Adafruit NeoPixel library).
3. Download the code from this repository and upload it to your ESP32s board.
4. Develop and deploy the mobile application according to your chosen framework (instructions not included in this repository).  The mobile application should communicate with the ESP32s via Wi-Fi or Bluetooth (depending on implementation).

**Mobile App Integration:**

The mobile application should be designed to connect to the ESP32s over Wi-Fi or Bluetooth.  The app should provide functionalities to:

* Send color data (e.g., RGB values) to the ESP32s for LED control.
* Trigger specific animation routines on the ESP32s.
* Adjust brightness levels and send commands to the ESP32s.

**Customization:**

* The provided code can be further customized with additional animations and functionalities.
* The mobile application design and features can be tailored to your specific preferences.

### Additional Notes

* Refer to the code comments for specific details on library usage and configuration.
* Ensure compatibility between your chosen NeoPixel strip and the library used in the code.

This ESP32s NeoPixel control with mobile app provides a starting point for creating interactive LED lighting projects.  Feel free to explore the code, customize the features, and develop your own creative lighting applications!
